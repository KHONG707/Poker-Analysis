# Poker-Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to simulate and analyze poker hands, focusing on Object-Oriented principles. The key components are:

- **Deck Class**: Manages a deck of cards, allowing shuffling, dealing, and card retrieval.

- **Card Class**: Represents individual playing cards with suit, rank, and utility functions.

- **CardHand Class**: Represents a player's hand, allowing the addition of cards.

- **CardHandScorer Class**: Analyzes a player's hand, determining the Poker score based on various criteria.

- **PokerScore Class**: Holds and manages different Poker scores for a hand, including a flexible scoring system.


## Functionality
- **Randomized Card Dealing**: The program deals cards to simulate various poker hands.

- **Scoring and Analysis**: Utilizes the CardHandScorer class to evaluate Poker scores for each hand dealt.

- **Probability Analysis**: After simulating a significant number of hands, the program outputs the frequency of each Poker score, providing insights into the probability of different hands.

- **Graphical Representation**: A class is implemented to visually represent poker hands, illustrating the odds of getting each hand after running the simulation multiple times.


## Purpose
The project demonstrates the design and interaction of classes to model a poker game. Additionally, it provides a tool for analyzing the probability of various poker hands, contributing to a deeper understanding of the game's dynamics. The graphical representation enhances the user experience by presenting the information in a visually accessible manner.



## Probability Output
The program outputs the frequency of each Poker score after running simulations, providing insights into the likelihood of different hands in a poker game.
